/* Write a program to determine the sizes of char, short, int
 * and long variables both signed and unsigned by printing
 * appropriate values from standard headers and by direct
 * computation.
 * 
 * Implementation details
 * =======================
 * The easy way to find the sizes is simply by using the limits 
 * header file which exposes them as constants.
 * 
 * Another way to compute the sizes is using bitwise manipulations; given
 * an integral type T, its maximum value should be ~0.
