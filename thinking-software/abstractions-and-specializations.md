# Abstractions and Specializations

Sometimes when developing a solution I stop my coding for a several minutes
visualizing my work as a battle between abstractions and specializations.

The contrast of these opposites is a major characteristic of any program
developed ever and the talent, experience and determination of the developer
are stamping the final product.

Countless projects have failed miserably due to an imbalance of these
constituents.

What is more interesting is the fact that quite of few of these failures had
been driven by top level programmers who despite their talent somehow got lost
in the process of overgeneralization, as they were trying to solve their
particular problem using a very abstract and generic approach. Although such an
approach might stand out from a pure theoretical perspective, the overhead of
the generalization was such that led to very slow pace of advancement, code
that was difficult to be adapted from newcomers to the team and usually
resulted to an over engineered platform that was not able to follow the
competitorâ€™s evolution pace.
